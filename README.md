# Composer-enabled Upstream template
## Experimental

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for forking new upstreams that work with the Platform's integrated
Composer build process.

Because it is under active development, you should not create permanent/production sites using this repository
yet. We make no guarantees of backwards compatibility. Merging new updates from this repository may break existing
sites.
